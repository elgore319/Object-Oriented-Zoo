# Object-Oriented-Zoo

Level 1:
    * Abstact Class Animal has been created with the abstract methods makeSound() and move().

    * Subclasses Bird, Fish, and Mammal have been created; all with the overrided methods from 
    Animal Abstract Class and with their own unique methods.

    * They all make different sounds and can move.

    * Implemented interfaces Swimmable to all 
    
    * Subclasses that require it.
    
    * Used getter and setter methods
    
    * Used extends and implements
    
    * Created and stored some animals in the ArrayList<Animals> and looped through them to output their names, movement, and sound.

    AI was not used in this level.

Level 2:

    * Added another interface called Movements what contained a few different methods for that pertain to specifically mammals and birds as many species of both can walk, run, jump, and fly. 

    * i updated main to use theses methods, like making the cat run and the bird jump.

    Ai was not used in this level.

Level 3:

    * Refactored into packages: Animals, Interfaces, and Main.

    * ZooManager class was created and with the assistance of CoPilot.

    * CoPilot assisted in creating the Constructor, Menu method, and  loadAnimals method. I personally didnt know where to start with those and it helped quite a bit.

    * The methods are called in the main class and the menu and subsequent methods like moveAnimals and DisplayAnimals work as needed.

    * There is a bit of expection handling in the menu method for incorrect inputs.

    All levels complete.
