# Object-Oriented-Zoo
Level 1 - AI Reflection

What AI tools did you use?

- I used the Copilot assistant in vscode 

What was helpful or confusing?

- Nothing was really confusing, though it was having an issue with duplicating unneccessary files and adding unneccessary methods for the sake of having something to @Override. 

What changes did you make and why?

- Most of the code it wrote was presentable, though I did change the code in the ZooDemo class main method to include a foreach loop instead of a normal for loop that way the code was more condensed

Level 2 - AI Reflection

Include your AI prompt and AI output.

AI prompt:

```
Create a second interface (e.g., Walkable, Climbable, Burrower) with at least one method.

At least 2 animals must implement both interfaces.

Add new methods/behaviors for the second interface.

Update Main.java to demonstrate these new methods.
```

- I forgot to copy the output before closing the project, but it essentually did everything correctly, adding the new interface "Walkable" and updating the eligable animals (Bird and Mammal classes)

Explain what you kept or changed and why.

- The AI implemented the changes pretty well so I ended up keeping it all, the code ran fine and did everything required as well as not being overbearing to read.

Level 3 - AI Reflection

What bugs or issues did AI introduce?

- Copilot does not have the ability to delete files, so it duplicated them in order to move them into packages.

How did you fix or improve it?

- I undid the action and manually moved the files

Would you use this code in a real-world app?

- I believe its plausible for this code to be used in a simplistic app
